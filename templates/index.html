  <h2 style="color:powderblue">Who is Prajwal Umale :</h2>
  <h5 style="color:powderblue">Hello everyone I am a 13 years old school going boy.I study in 8th standard
    .And I started learning programming in Lockdown.And as I have made this website I am also a web developer now
    .I started learning web development after my final exams of standard 7 th .And as I had a coding experience I was
    able to learn it well .I didn't learned web development from a particular video or website.I learnt it by  watching many videos on youtube
    and visiting many helpful websites .I don't play any games ,because I had played almost all the games in lockdown and after playing
  a game for a certain period of time I would feel that the game is boring .So after playing many games I thought
  that 'all games are boring' and quited searching,downloading and playing different games again and again .And thus I am
  a "Non - gamer"</h5><br>
  <h2 style="color:powderblue" >My Friends :</h2>
  <h5 style="color:powderblue">I have many Friends ,but there is always a best friend.And my best friend is Ronak Chand
  .He lives just 2 buildings far from my building .He is my best friend ,but unfortunately his not in my class.But I have
  many good friends in my class too.Actually we are a group .And the names of my friends in my class are Tejas,Kewal,Aryan and Shivang .Abdullah is not in
  this group but he is also my good friend.And one friend I should mention is my uncle .He is also like a friend to me.</h5><br>

  <h2 style="color:powderblue" >My inspiration:  </h2>
  <h5 style="color:powderblue">My inspiration is the one ,who is the inspiration of many software engineers "
   ELON MUSK ".His story of success is just like a bollywood story of a normal person becoming a billionaire.</h5><br>
